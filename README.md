Well tuned profile ISF and meal management in Hybrid Closed Loop (HCL) is essential ....  also for transitioning to Full Closed Loop (FCL) (see default branch "FCL-book-autoISF" in https://github.com/bernie4375/FCL-potential-autoISF-research-)

Disclaimer – Important to read and understand. - 
Authors are no medical professionals but T1 diabetics (or parents of a T1D child) who report their -limited - understanding and experience, in an effort to contribute to a growing body of knowledge, and to facilitate development of patient centered solutions. 
Nothing in this site is medical advice, but it is meant to stimulate patient-driven self-responsible re-search. Anything you try to conclude for yourself you do on own risk. This is by no means a medical product, but what is offered is a toolset for participating in development. 
Never copy what others report to use, but investigate and adjust to your data. Neglecting safety instructions, and just using the “buttons” that are made available in a supposed “learning by doing” mode, can be dangerous.

Please observe that making your settings should be done step-by-step in this sequence: 1. Set insulin model (time-to-peak, DIA)  2. Set a correct basal rate (that keeps you stable at iob and cob near zero in open loop) 3. Determine your
Factors (ISF, IC) and other settings 4. Do your Meal Management such that your desired (realistic) %TIR results. Besides an initial meal bolus (and anti-hypo snacks, if needed), try not to interfere with your closed loop  5. Observe if/when you have altered general insulin sensitivity (e.g. during and after exercise), and learn to temporarily adjust settings (and/or use Autosens, an Automation, or individually tuned dynamic factors). 

Stable Bluetooth connectivity, reliable CGM values, and selecting/changing cannula sites for reliable insulin delivery is the solid foundation you cannot do without. Resort to bg meter measurements and to using an insulin pen if/when thze necessary conditions are not given!

Stay connected with your doctor/medical team. (Even if not knowing much about your DIY loop, they should be valueable experts in setting a correct basal, and also valueable consultants in other issues). 
Please also stay connected, and share experiences, with the DIY looper communities.
